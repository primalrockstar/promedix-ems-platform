### AVPU Scale:
- **Alert**: Patient is awake and aware
- **Verbal**: Patient responds to verbal stimuli

- **Unresponsive**: No response to any stimuli

### Vital Signs Assessment:
- Respiratory rate: 12-20 breaths per minute (adult)
- Pulse rate: 60-100 beats per minute (adult)

The EMS system operates on the principle of rapid assessment, stabilization, and transport to appropriate medical facilities.
