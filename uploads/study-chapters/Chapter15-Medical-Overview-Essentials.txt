## Introduction to Medical Emergencies

Medical emergencies require systematic assessment and evidence-based interventions within EMT-B scope of practice. Understanding pathophysiology guides appropriate treatment decisions.

### Key Components of Medical Assessment:
- **Primary Assessment**: Airway, breathing, circulation (ABC)
- **Secondary Assessment**: Focused history and physical exam
- **Vital Signs Monitoring**: Continuous assessment of patient status
- **Treatment Prioritization**: Life-threatening conditions first

### EMT-B Medical Scope:
- Patient assessment using systematic approach
- Basic airway management and oxygen therapy
- Medication assistance within approved protocols
- CPR and automated external defibrillation
- Basic wound care and bleeding control
- Patient stabilization and transport preparation

### Medical Assessment Priorities:
- **Life-threatening conditions**: Airway compromise, respiratory failure, shock
- **Urgent conditions**: Chest pain, altered mental status, severe pain
- **Non-urgent conditions**: Minor injuries, stable chronic conditions

### Chief Complaint Assessment:
- **OPQRST Method**: Onset, Provocation, Quality, Radiation, Severity, Time
- **SAMPLE History**: Signs/symptoms, Allergies, Medications, Past medical history, Last meal, Events
- **Documentation**: Accurate recording of findings and interventions

### Vital Signs Standards:
- Blood pressure: Normal 90-140 systolic, 60-90 diastolic
- Pulse rate: 60-100 beats per minute (adult)
- Respiratory rate: 12-20 breaths per minute (adult)
- Temperature: 98.6°F (37°C) ± 1°F normal range
- Oxygen saturation: 95-100% on room air

Medical emergency management follows established protocols with emphasis on rapid recognition, appropriate intervention, and timely transport to definitive care.
