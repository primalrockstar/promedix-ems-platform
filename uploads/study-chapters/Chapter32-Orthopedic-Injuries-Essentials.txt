# Chapter 32: Orthopedic Injuries Essentials

## Introduction to Orthopedic Injuries

Orthopedic injuries involve bones, joints, muscles, and connective tissues. Proper assessment, immobilization, and pain management prevent further complications and disability.

### Key Components of Orthopedic Assessment:
- **Mechanism of injury**: Direct force, indirect force, twisting mechanisms
- **Neurovascular assessment**: Pulse, motor function, sensation distal to injury
- **Deformity recognition**: Angulation, shortening, rotation abnormalities
- **Pain and swelling**: Location, severity, associated symptoms

### EMT-B Orthopedic Scope:
- Fracture and dislocation immobilization using splints
- Neurovascular assessment before and after splinting
- Pain management through proper positioning and immobilization
- Bleeding control from open fractures
- Cold application for swelling reduction
- Patient transport with appropriate positioning

### Fracture Classifications:
- **Closed fractures**: Skin integrity maintained, no external bleeding
- **Open fractures**: Bone protrudes or skin broken over fracture site
- **Displaced fractures**: Bone ends not aligned properly
- **Comminuted fractures**: Bone broken into multiple pieces

### Splinting Principles:
- **Immobilize joint above and below**: Include adjacent joints in splint
- **Assess neurovascular status**: Check pulse, motor, sensation before and after
- **Pad pressure points**: Prevent pressure sores and discomfort
- **Secure firmly**: Prevent movement while maintaining circulation

### Common Orthopedic Injuries:
- **Upper extremity**: Clavicle, humerus, radius, ulna fractures
- **Lower extremity**: Femur, tibia, fibula, ankle fractures
- **Spine injuries**: Cervical, thoracic, lumbar vertebrae
- **Pelvis fractures**: High-energy trauma, potential for severe bleeding

### Neurovascular Assessment:
- **Pulse check**: Radial, ulnar, dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial
- **Motor function**: Ability to move fingers, toes, grip strength
- **Sensation**: Light touch, sharp/dull discrimination
- **Capillary refill**: <2 seconds normal, >2 seconds abnormal

### Special Considerations:
- **Femur fractures**: Potential for significant blood loss, shock risk
- **Pelvic fractures**: Assess for internal bleeding, stabilize with sheet
- **Joint dislocations**: Immobilize in position found, do not reduce
- **Amputations**: Control bleeding, preserve amputated part

### Splinting Materials:
- **Rigid splints**: Board splints, vacuum splints, commercial devices
- **Soft splints**: Pillows, blankets, slings for support
- **Traction splints**: Specific for femur fractures with protocols
- **Improvised splints**: Magazines, newspapers, sticks when needed

Orthopedic injury management prioritizes neurovascular preservation, proper immobilization, pain control, and prevention of further injury through appropriate splinting techniques and patient handling.
