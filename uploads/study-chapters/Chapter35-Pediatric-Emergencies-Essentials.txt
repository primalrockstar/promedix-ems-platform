# Chapter 35: Pediatric Emergencies Essentials

## Introduction to Pediatric Emergencies

Pediatric patients present unique challenges requiring age-appropriate assessment techniques, equipment, and treatment approaches. Children are not small adults and require specialized emergency care.

### Key Components of Pediatric Assessment:
- **Age-appropriate techniques**: Modified assessment for developmental stage
- **Parental involvement**: Use parents/caregivers for comfort and history
- **Growth and development**: Normal vs. abnormal findings by age group
- **Vital sign variations**: Age-specific normal ranges and assessment methods

### EMT-B Pediatric Scope:
- Age-appropriate airway management and oxygen delivery
- Pediatric-specific medication dosing and administration
- Child abuse recognition and reporting protocols
- Family-centered care and communication techniques
- Specialized equipment use for different age groups
- Developmental consideration in patient interaction

### Age Group Classifications:
- **Neonate**: 0-1 month, transitioning from intrauterine life
- **Infant**: 1-12 months, rapid growth and development
- **Toddler**: 1-3 years, mobile, stranger anxiety common
- **Preschool**: 3-6 years, can communicate needs, separation anxiety

### Pediatric Vital Signs (Normal Ranges):
- **Heart rate**: Newborn 120-160, Infant 100-160, Child 80-110 bpm
- **Respiratory rate**: Newborn 30-60, Infant 25-50, Child 20-30 per minute
- **Blood pressure**: Systolic = 80 + (2 × age in years) mmHg
- **Temperature**: Same as adults, 98.6°F (37°C) normal

### Airway Management:
- **Anatomical differences**: Large head, small airway, prominent tongue
- **Positioning**: Sniffing position, towel under shoulders for infants
- **Bag-valve-mask**: Use appropriate size mask, gentle ventilation
- **Airway adjuncts**: Oral airways rarely used, nasal airways contraindicated

### Common Pediatric Emergencies:
- **Respiratory distress**: Leading cause of cardiac arrest in children
- **Fever and febrile seizures**: Common, usually not dangerous
- **Dehydration**: Rapid fluid loss, poor skin turgor, altered mental status
- **Poisoning**: Accidental ingestion, household products, medications

### Respiratory Distress Signs:
- **Early signs**: Tachypnea, nasal flaring, retractions, restlessness
- **Late signs**: Bradypnea, cyanosis, altered mental status, bradycardia
- **Positioning**: Allow position of comfort, usually upright
- **Oxygen delivery**: High-flow oxygen via appropriate delivery device

### Child Abuse Recognition:
- **Physical indicators**: Inconsistent injury patterns, various healing stages
- **Behavioral indicators**: Fearfulness, inappropriate behavior for age
- **Reporting requirements**: Mandatory reporting to appropriate authorities
- **Documentation**: Objective findings, direct quotes from child/caregiver

### Family-Centered Care:
- **Parent involvement**: Allow parents to comfort child when possible
- **Communication**: Age-appropriate explanations, honest but gentle
- **Separation anxiety**: Minimize when safe to do so
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Respect family values and practices

### Equipment Considerations:
- **Size-appropriate**: Different sizes for different age groups
- **Pediatric drug dosing**: Weight-based calculations, use reference cards
- **Immobilization**: Car seats for transport when appropriate
- **Pain assessment**: Age-appropriate pain scales and comfort measures

### Transport Decisions:
- **High priority**: Respiratory distress, altered mental status, shock
- **Pediatric centers**: Specialized care for critically ill children
- **Family transport**: Allow family member when space and safety permit
- **Communication**: Early notification to receiving facility

Pediatric emergency management emphasizes age-appropriate assessment, family-centered care, recognition of anatomical and physiological differences, and early identification of serious conditions requiring specialized intervention.
