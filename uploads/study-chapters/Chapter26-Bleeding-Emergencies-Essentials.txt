# Chapter 26: Bleeding Emergencies Essentials

## Introduction to Bleeding Emergencies

Hemorrhage control is a fundamental EMT-B skill that can be life-saving. Understanding bleeding types and appropriate interventions is critical for patient survival.

### Key Components of Bleeding Assessment:
- **Bleeding severity**: Life-threatening vs. minor hemorrhage
- **Bleeding source**: External vs. internal bleeding
- **Patient stability**: Vital signs and perfusion status
- **Mechanism of injury**: Sharp objects, blunt trauma, medical conditions

### EMT-B Bleeding Control Scope:
- Direct pressure application to bleeding sites
- Pressure point utilization for extremity bleeding
- Tourniquet application for severe extremity hemorrhage
- Hemostatic agent application when available
- Shock recognition and basic management
- Rapid transport coordination

### Types of External Bleeding:
- **Arterial**: Bright red, spurting blood with pulse
- **Venous**: Dark red, steady flow of blood
- **Capillary**: Slow oozing, minimal blood loss
- **Mixed**: Combination of arterial and venous bleeding

### Bleeding Control Methods:
- **Direct pressure**: First-line treatment, gauze pads with firm pressure
- **Elevation**: Raise injured extremity above heart level when possible
- **Pressure points**: Compress artery against bone to reduce flow
- **Tourniquet**: Last resort for severe extremity bleeding

### Tourniquet Application:
- **Indications**: Severe extremity bleeding uncontrolled by direct pressure
- **Placement**: 2-3 inches above wound, never over joints
- **Tightening**: Until bleeding stops completely
- **Documentation**: Time of application, reassessment intervals

### Internal Bleeding Signs:
- **Abdominal**: Rigid abdomen, guarding, referred pain
- **Chest**: Difficulty breathing, decreased breath sounds
- **General**: Pale skin, weak pulse, altered mental status
- **Management**: Position of comfort, rapid transport, IV access preparation

### Shock Progression:
- **Class I**: <15% blood loss, minimal symptoms
- **Class II**: 15-30% loss, increased heart rate, anxiety
- **Class III**: 30-40% loss, hypotension, confusion
- **Class IV**: >40% loss, unconsciousness, cardiac arrest

Bleeding emergency management prioritizes rapid hemorrhage control, shock prevention, and expedited transport while maintaining scene safety and infection control protocols.
