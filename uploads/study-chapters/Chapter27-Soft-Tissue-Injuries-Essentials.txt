# Chapter 27: Soft-Tissue Injuries Essentials

## Introduction to Soft-Tissue Injuries

Soft-tissue injuries involve damage to skin, muscles, blood vessels, and nerves. Proper assessment and management prevent complications and promote healing.

### Key Components of Soft-Tissue Assessment:
- **Injury classification**: Closed vs. open wounds
- **Wound severity**: Depth, size, and location assessment
- **Contamination level**: Clean vs. dirty wounds
- **Associated injuries**: Underlying structures involvement

### EMT-B Soft-Tissue Scope:
- Wound cleaning and irrigation with sterile saline
- Sterile dressing application and bandaging
- Bleeding control using direct pressure
- Pain management through positioning and support
- Infection prevention using universal precautions
- Tetanus status documentation when possible

### Open Wound Types:
- **Abrasions**: Superficial scraping injuries, minimal bleeding
- **Lacerations**: Clean cuts through skin layers
- **Punctures**: Deep, narrow wounds with minimal external bleeding
- **Avulsions**: Tissue torn away, may have flap present

### Closed Injury Types:
- **Contusions**: Bruising without skin break
- **Hematomas**: Blood collection under skin
- **Crush injuries**: Extensive tissue damage from compression
- **Compartment syndrome**: Pressure buildup in muscle compartments

### Wound Care Principles:
- **Universal precautions**: Gloves, eye protection, appropriate barriers
- **Hemorrhage control**: Direct pressure, elevation when appropriate
- **Cleaning**: Remove visible debris, irrigate with sterile saline
- **Dressing**: Sterile gauze pads, secure with bandages

### Special Considerations:
- **Impaled objects**: Stabilize in place, do not remove
- **Amputations**: Control bleeding, preserve amputated part
- **Burns**: Cool with water, cover with sterile dressings
- **Animal bites**: Clean thoroughly, document for rabies evaluation

### Infection Prevention:
- **Sterile technique**: Use sterile supplies when available
- **Wound irrigation**: Remove debris and contaminants
- **Proper bandaging**: Keep wound clean and dry
- **Patient education**: Signs of infection, follow-up care importance

### Documentation Requirements:
- Wound location, size, and depth
- Mechanism of injury and time of occurrence
- Treatment provided and patient response
- Tetanus immunization status if known

Soft-tissue injury management emphasizes bleeding control, infection prevention, proper wound care, and appropriate documentation while maintaining sterile technique and patient comfort.
