# Chapter 33: Environmental Emergencies Essentials

## Introduction to Environmental Emergencies

Environmental emergencies result from exposure to extreme temperatures, water, altitude, or hazardous substances. Recognition and appropriate intervention prevent serious complications and death.

### Key Components of Environmental Assessment:
- **Environmental conditions**: Temperature, humidity, wind, water exposure
- **Duration of exposure**: Length of time in adverse conditions
- **Patient's condition**: Core body temperature, mental status, skin findings
- **Predisposing factors**: Age, medical conditions, medications, clothing

### EMT-B Environmental Scope:
- Temperature regulation through passive and active rewarming/cooling
- Airway management for compromised patients
- Fluid replacement preparation for heat emergencies
- Spinal immobilization for water-related trauma
- Scene safety assessment for ongoing hazards
- Prevention of further heat loss or gain

### Heat-Related Emergencies:
- **Heat exhaustion**: Profuse sweating, weakness, nausea, normal mental status
- **Heat stroke**: Altered mental status, hot skin, high body temperature
- **Heat cramps**: Muscle spasms from salt and fluid loss
- **Hyperthermia**: Core temperature >104째F (40째C), medical emergency

### Cold-Related Emergencies:
- **Hypothermia**: Core temperature <95째F (35째C), altered mental status
- **Frostbite**: Tissue freezing, usually extremities and exposed areas
- **Frostnip**: Superficial cold injury, skin red and painful
- **Trench foot**: Prolonged exposure to cold, wet conditions

### Heat Emergency Management:
- **Remove from heat source**: Move to cool, shaded area
- **Cooling methods**: Remove excess clothing, apply cool packs to neck, armpits, groin
- **Fluid replacement**: Conscious patients may drink cool water
- **Monitor vital signs**: Watch for signs of shock or deterioration

### Cold Emergency Management:
- **Remove from cold**: Move to warm environment when safe
- **Handle gently**: Prevent further tissue damage from rough handling
- **Passive rewarming**: Insulation, warm blankets, heated ambulance
- **Protect frozen areas**: Do not rub, massage, or thaw if refreezing possible

### Water Emergencies:
- **Near-drowning**: Submersion with survival, potential hypoxia
- **Diving injuries**: Spinal trauma from shallow water impacts
- **Hypothermia**: Rapid heat loss in cold water
- **Rescue breathing**: Begin immediately upon water removal

### Lightning Injuries:
- **Cardiac arrest**: Primary cause of death from lightning strikes
- **Burns**: Entry and exit wounds, internal organ damage
- **Neurological effects**: Confusion, paralysis, sensory loss
- **Multiple casualties**: Reverse triage - treat "dead" first

### Prevention Education:
- **Heat safety**: Hydration, appropriate clothing, activity modification
- **Cold safety**: Layered clothing, dry conditions, recognition of symptoms
- **Water safety**: Swimming ability, life jacket use, diving precautions
- **Lightning safety**: Indoor shelter, avoid metal objects and high areas

Environmental emergency management emphasizes rapid recognition, appropriate temperature regulation, airway protection, and prevention of further environmental exposure while ensuring scene safety.
