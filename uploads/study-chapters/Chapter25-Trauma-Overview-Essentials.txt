# Chapter 25: Trauma Overview Essentials

## Introduction to Trauma Emergencies

Trauma is the leading cause of death in patients under 45 years old. Systematic assessment and rapid intervention within EMT-B scope can significantly improve patient outcomes.

### Key Components of Trauma Assessment:
- **Mechanism of injury (MOI)**: Understanding how injury occurred
- **Primary survey**: Airway, breathing, circulation, disability, exposure
- **Secondary survey**: Head-to-toe systematic examination
- **Vital signs trending**: Continuous monitoring for deterioration

### EMT-B Trauma Scope:
- Spinal immobilization and cervical spine protection
- Airway management with C-spine precautions
- Hemorrhage control using direct pressure
- Shock recognition and basic management
- Splinting of suspected fractures
- Rapid transport decision-making

### Trauma Mechanisms:
- **Blunt trauma**: Motor vehicle crashes, falls, sports injuries
- **Penetrating trauma**: Gunshot wounds, stabbings, impalement
- **Burn injuries**: Thermal, chemical, electrical burns
- **Blast injuries**: Explosions causing multiple injury types

### Primary Survey (ABCDE):
- **Airway**: Maintain with C-spine protection
- **Breathing**: Assess rate, depth, bilateral chest rise
- **Circulation**: Control bleeding, assess perfusion
- **Disability**: Brief neurological assessment (AVPU)
- **Exposure**: Remove clothing to assess injuries, prevent hypothermia

### Shock Recognition:
- **Compensated shock**: Increased heart rate, normal blood pressure
- **Decompensated shock**: Decreased blood pressure, altered mental status
- **Signs**: Weak pulse, pale skin, delayed capillary refill
- **Management**: Control bleeding, elevate legs, rapid transport

### Transport Decisions:
- **Load and go**: Unstable vital signs, penetrating trauma to torso
- **Stay and play**: Stable patients with isolated injuries
- **Golden hour**: Critical trauma patients need definitive care within 60 minutes
- **Trauma centers**: Appropriate facility selection based on injury severity

Trauma management follows systematic protocols emphasizing rapid assessment, life-threatening injury identification, and timely transport to appropriate trauma care facilities.
