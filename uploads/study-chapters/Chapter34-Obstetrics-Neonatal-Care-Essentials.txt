# Chapter 34: Obstetrics and Neonatal Care Essentials

## Introduction to Obstetrics and Neonatal Care

Obstetric emergencies require specialized knowledge of pregnancy, labor, and delivery processes. EMT-B providers must be prepared to assist with emergency deliveries and neonatal resuscitation.

### Key Components of Obstetric Assessment:
- **Pregnancy history**: Gestational age, previous pregnancies, complications
- **Labor assessment**: Contraction frequency, duration, intensity
- **Delivery signs**: Crowning, urge to push, bloody show
- **Emergency conditions**: Bleeding, prolapsed cord, breech presentation

### EMT-B Obstetric Scope:
- Emergency delivery assistance in field settings
- Neonatal resuscitation and initial care
- Postpartum hemorrhage control
- Umbilical cord care and clamping
- Patient comfort and psychological support
- Transport decision-making for mother and infant

### Normal Delivery Process:
- **First stage**: Cervical dilation and effacement (onset to full dilation)
- **Second stage**: Delivery of baby (full dilation to birth)
- **Third stage**: Delivery of placenta (birth to placental expulsion)
- **Fourth stage**: Recovery period (first 1-2 hours postpartum)

### Emergency Delivery Management:
- **Sterile technique**: Clean hands, sterile gloves, clean towels
- **Positioning**: Supine with knees flexed and separated
- **Crowning support**: Gentle hand pressure to control head delivery
- **Airway clearance**: Suction mouth then nose immediately after head delivery

### Neonatal Assessment (APGAR):
- **Appearance**: Skin color (blue, pink, completely pink)
- **Pulse**: Heart rate (<100, >100 bpm)
- **Grimace**: Reflex irritability (none, grimace, cry)
- **Activity**: Muscle tone (limp, some flexion, active motion)
- **Respiratory effort**: (absent, slow/irregular, good cry)

### Neonatal Resuscitation:
- **Stimulation**: Dry and stimulate breathing by rubbing back
- **Positioning**: Slight head-down position to drain secretions
- **Suction**: Mouth first, then nose if needed
- **Ventilation**: Bag-valve-mask if no respirations after stimulation

### Obstetric Complications:
- **Prolapsed cord**: Cord presents before baby, elevate hips, rapid transport
- **Breech delivery**: Buttocks first, support body, do not pull
- **Shoulder dystocia**: Shoulders stuck, McRoberts position
- **Postpartum hemorrhage**: >500mL blood loss, massage fundus, rapid transport

### Umbilical Cord Care:
- **Timing**: Clamp after cord stops pulsating (1-3 minutes)
- **Placement**: Clamps 4 inches apart, cut between clamps
- **Sterile technique**: Use sterile scissors and clamps
- **Bleeding control**: Ensure clamps are secure, check for bleeding

### Postpartum Care:
- **Fundal massage**: Prevent/control hemorrhage through uterine contraction
- **Perineal inspection**: Check for tears requiring repair
- **Vital signs**: Monitor for shock from blood loss
- **Newborn care**: Keep warm, assess breathing, APGAR scoring

Obstetric and neonatal emergency management emphasizes sterile technique, gentle assistance with natural processes, immediate newborn care, and rapid transport when complications arise.
