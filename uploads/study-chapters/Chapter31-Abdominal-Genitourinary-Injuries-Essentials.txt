# Chapter 31: Abdominal and Genitourinary Injuries Essentials

## Introduction to Abdominal and Genitourinary Injuries

Abdominal and genitourinary injuries can be life-threatening due to potential internal bleeding and organ damage. Systematic assessment and rapid transport are critical for patient survival.

### Key Components of Abdominal Assessment:
- **Mechanism of injury**: Blunt vs. penetrating trauma assessment
- **Visual inspection**: Distension, bruising, penetrating objects
- **Palpation technique**: Gentle assessment for tenderness and rigidity
- **Vital signs monitoring**: Signs of internal bleeding and shock

### EMT-B Abdominal Scope:
- External bleeding control and wound management
- Pain assessment using patient positioning
- Shock recognition and basic management
- Impaled object stabilization (do not remove)
- Rapid transport decision-making
- Patient positioning for comfort and airway protection

### Common Abdominal Injuries:
- **Blunt trauma**: Motor vehicle crashes, falls, sports injuries
- **Penetrating trauma**: Stab wounds, gunshot wounds, impaled objects
- **Internal bleeding**: Organ laceration, vessel rupture
- **Peritonitis**: Inflammation from organ perforation

### Assessment Techniques:
- **Visual inspection**: Look before touching, note distension or bruising
- **Gentle palpation**: Start away from pain, assess all quadrants
- **Guarding assessment**: Voluntary vs. involuntary muscle rigidity
- **Pain characteristics**: Location, severity, radiation patterns

### Genitourinary Injuries:
- **Kidney trauma**: Flank pain, hematuria, shock signs
- **Bladder injuries**: Inability to urinate, pelvic pain
- **Genital trauma**: External bleeding, swelling, pain
- **Privacy considerations**: Maintain patient dignity during assessment

### Management Priorities:
- **Position of comfort**: Usually supine with knees flexed
- **Nothing by mouth**: NPO status for potential surgery
- **Impaled objects**: Stabilize in place with bulky dressings
- **Internal bleeding signs**: Monitor for shock development

### Transport Decisions:
- **High priority**: Penetrating trauma, signs of internal bleeding
- **Trauma center**: Severe mechanism of injury, unstable vital signs
- **IV access**: Prepare for fluid resuscitation en route
- **Continuous monitoring**: Frequent vital sign reassessment

Abdominal and genitourinary injury management emphasizes gentle assessment, shock recognition, appropriate positioning, and rapid transport to trauma-capable facilities while maintaining patient dignity.
