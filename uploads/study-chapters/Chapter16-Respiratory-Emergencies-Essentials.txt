# Chapter 16: Respiratory Emergencies Essentials

## Introduction to Respiratory Emergencies

Respiratory emergencies are life-threatening conditions requiring immediate assessment and intervention. The respiratory system delivers oxygen to tissues and removes carbon dioxide waste.

### Key Components of Respiratory Assessment:
- **Airway patency**: Clear, maintainable airway
- **Breathing adequacy**: Rate, depth, and effort assessment
- **Gas exchange**: Oxygen saturation monitoring
- **Circulation support**: Perfusion to respiratory muscles

### EMT-B Respiratory Scope:
- Airway opening maneuvers (head-tilt, jaw-thrust)
- Oxygen administration via nasal cannula or mask
- Bag-valve-mask ventilation assistance
- Airway adjuncts (oral and nasal airways)
- Pulse oximetry monitoring
- Position of comfort for breathing

### Common Respiratory Emergencies:
- **Asthma**: Bronchospasm with wheezing, shortness of breath
- **COPD**: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation
- **Pneumonia**: Infection causing fever, productive cough
- **Pulmonary edema**: Fluid in lungs, often cardiac-related

### Respiratory Distress Signs:
- **Mild distress**: Slight increase in respiratory rate, minimal accessory muscle use
- **Moderate distress**: Obvious breathing difficulty, use of accessory muscles
- **Severe distress**: Tripod positioning, cyanosis, altered mental status
- **Respiratory failure**: Inadequate ventilation, requires immediate intervention

### Oxygen Therapy Guidelines:
- Nasal cannula: 1-6 LPM (24-44% oxygen)
- Simple face mask: 6-10 LPM (35-60% oxygen)
- Non-rebreather mask: 10-15 LPM (60-95% oxygen)
- Bag-valve-mask: 15 LPM with reservoir (nearly 100% oxygen)

### Normal Respiratory Values:
- Adult rate: 12-20 breaths per minute
- Pediatric rate: 15-30 breaths per minute
- Infant rate: 25-50 breaths per minute
- Tidal volume: 500-800 mL per breath (adult)

Respiratory emergency management emphasizes early recognition, appropriate oxygen therapy, and rapid transport while maintaining airway patency and adequate ventilation.
