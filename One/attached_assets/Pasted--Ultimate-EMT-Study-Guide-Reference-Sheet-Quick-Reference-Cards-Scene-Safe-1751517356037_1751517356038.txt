## Chapter 2: Workforce Safety and Wellness üõ°Ô∏è

### **Personal Safety Hierarchy** (CRITICAL CONCEPT)
```
SELF ‚Üí PARTNER ‚Üí PATIENT ‚Üí BYSTANDERS
```
*You cannot help others if you become a casualty*

### **Wellness Foundation Triad**
1. **Nutrition** - Balanced meals, complex carbs, adequate hydration (water best)
2. **Exercise** - 30+ min, 5+ days/week (cardio, strength, flexibility)
3. **Sleep** - 7-9 hours minimum (50% of EMS get <6 hours - concerning statistic)

### **Infection Control Hierarchy**
1. **Hand Washing** - Most effective disease prevention method
2. **Standard Precautions** - Treat all patients as potentially infected
3. **Universal Precautions** - OSHA bloodborne pathogen guidelines
4. **PPE** - Barrier protection with proper sequence

### **PPE Donning/Doffing Sequence** (Practical Skill)

**Donning Order:**
1. Gown
2. Mask/Respirator
3. Eye protection
4. Gloves

**Doffing Order:**
1. **Gloves FIRST** - Most contaminated
2. Eye protection
3. Gown
4. Mask/Respirator LAST

### **Scene Hazards & Safety Zones**

| Hazard Type | Safety Zone/Distance | Key Safety Points |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Hazmat** | Upwind/uphill, read placards from distance | Don't enter until scene cleared by specialists |
| **Electricity** | One span of power poles | Never approach downed lines, assume energized |
| **Fire** | Outside collapse zone | Smoke inhalation, oxygen deficiency, toxic gases |
| **Violence** | Cover vs. concealment | Law enforcement secures scene first |
| **Vehicle Crash** | Upstream traffic control | Reflective markers, positioning for escape route |

### **Stress Management** (Important for Wellness)

**Physical Symptoms:** Fatigue, appetite changes, GI problems, headaches, insomnia
**Psychological Symptoms:** Fear, depression, guilt, anger, frustration, isolation

**Management Strategies:**
