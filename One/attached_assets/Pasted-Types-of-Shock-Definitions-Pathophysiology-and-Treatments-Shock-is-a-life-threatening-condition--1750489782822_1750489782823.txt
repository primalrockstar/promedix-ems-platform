Types of Shock: Definitions, Pathophysiology, and Treatments
Shock is a life-threatening condition where tissue perfusion is inadequate, leading to cellular hypoxia and organ dysfunction. Below are the four main types of shock, plus additional subtypes, with explanations, signs/symptoms, and treatments.

1. Hypovolemic Shock
Cause: Severe loss of blood or fluids → low circulating volume.

Hemorrhagic: Trauma, GI bleed, postpartum hemorrhage.

Non-Hemorrhagic: Dehydration (vomiting, diarrhea, burns).

Signs & Symptoms
Early (Compensated):

Tachycardia, tachypnea.

Pale, cool skin.

Weak peripheral pulses.

Normal BP (early).

Late (Decompensated):

Hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg).

Altered mental status (confusion, lethargy).

Oliguria (low urine output).

Treatment
Control bleeding (tourniquet, pressure).

Fluid resuscitation:

Crystalloids (NS, LR) bolus (20 mL/kg).

Blood products (if hemorrhagic).

Vasopressors (if fluids fail, e.g., norepinephrine).

2. Cardiogenic Shock
Cause: Heart failure → poor cardiac output.

Myocardial infarction (most common).

Cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, valve failure.

Signs & Symptoms
Hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg).

Pulmonary edema (crackles, dyspnea).

Jugular venous distension (JVD).

Weak, thready pulses.

Cool, clammy skin.

Treatment
Oxygen (NRB, CPAP if pulmonary edema).

Nitroglycerin (if BP stable, for ischemia).

Inotropes (dopamine, dobutamine).

Revascularization (PCI for STEMI).

Mechanical support (IABP, ECMO).

3. Distributive Shock
Cause: Vasodilation → blood pools in periphery.

Subtypes:
A. Septic Shock
Cause: Systemic infection → inflammatory vasodilation.

Signs:

Fever or hypothermia.

Tachycardia, tachypnea.

Warm, flushed skin (early).

Hypotension (late).

Treatment:

Antibiotics (broad-spectrum).

Fluid resuscitation (30 mL/kg crystalloids).

Vasopressors (norepinephrine).

B. Anaphylactic Shock
Cause: Severe allergic reaction → histamine release.

Signs:

Urticaria (hives), angioedema (swelling).

Stridor, wheezing.

Hypotension, tachycardia.

Treatment:

Epinephrine IM (0.3mg adult, 0.15mg pediatric).

Diphenhydramine (Benadryl).

Steroids (methylprednisolone).

Fluids + vasopressors if refractory.

C. Neurogenic Shock
Cause: Spinal cord injury (T6 or above) → loss of sympathetic tone.

Signs:

Hypotension + bradycardia (unique combo).

Warm, dry skin (no sweating below injury).

Flaccid paralysis.

Treatment:

Fluids (but avoid overload).

Vasopressors (norepinephrine, phenylephrine).

Atropine (if severe bradycardia).

4. Obstructive Shock
Cause: Physical blockage of blood flow.

Subtypes:
A. Pulmonary Embolism (PE)
Signs: Sudden dyspnea, hypoxia, tachycardia, hypotension.

Treatment:

Oxygen, fluids.

Anticoagulants (heparin).

Thrombolytics (tPA) if massive PE.

B. Cardiac Tamponade
Signs: Beck’s triad (hypotension, JVD, muffled heart sounds).

Treatment:

Pericardiocentesis (needle decompression).

C. Tension Pneumothorax
Signs: Tracheal deviation, absent breath sounds, hypotension.

Treatment:

Needle decompression (2nd intercostal space).

Chest tube.

Cardiogenic

Hypovolemic

Obstructive

Responsive (Distributive: Septic, Anaphylactic, Neurogenic)

Decompensated (End-stage shock)

General Shock Management (All Types)
ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation).

High-flow oxygen.

Fluid challenge (except cardiogenic shock).

Vasopressors (if hypotension persists).

Treat underlying cause.

Would you like a quick-reference table for field use?

yes
Here’s a quick-reference table summarizing the types of shock, key features, and emergency treatments:

Shock Types & Emergency Management
Type of Shock	Cause	Key Signs	Immediate Treatment
Hypovolemic	Blood/fluid loss	Tachycardia, cool skin, weak pulses	Fluids (NS/LR), blood, stop bleeding
Cardiogenic	Heart failure (e.g., MI)	Pulmonary edema, JVD, hypotension	Oxygen, nitroglycerin (if BP >90), inotropes
Septic	Infection → vasodilation	Fever, warm skin, hypotension	Antibiotics, fluids, norepinephrine
Anaphylactic	Severe allergy	Hives, stridor, hypotension	Epinephrine IM, Benadryl, steroids
Neurogenic	Spinal cord injury	Hypotension + bradycardia, warm skin	Fluids, vasopressors, atropine
Obstructive (PE)	Pulmonary embolism	Sudden dyspnea, hypoxia	Oxygen, heparin, tPA (if massive)
Obstructive (Tamponade)	Fluid around heart	Beck’s triad (JVD, muffled HS, hypotension)	Pericardiocentesis
Obstructive (Tension PTX)	Lung collapse	Tracheal deviation, absent breath sounds	Needle decompression
Universal Shock Actions
ABCs (Secure airway, high-flow O₂).

IV Access (Two large-bore lines if hemorrhagic).

Fluid Challenge (20–30 mL/kg NS/LR – avoid in cardiogenic).

Vasopressors (If BP remains low after fluids).

Treat Underlying Cause (e.g., epi for anaphylaxis, PCI for MI).

Shock Mnemonics
"CHORD" (Cardiogenic, Hypovolemic, Obstructive, Responsive [Distributive], Decompensated).

"VIP" for Hemorrhagic Shock:

Ventilate (O₂).

Infuse (fluids/blood).

Pump (vasopressors if needed).

When to Suspect Each Type
Clinical Clue	Likely Shock Type
Bleeding + tachycardia	Hypovolemic (hemorrhagic)
Chest pain + crackles	Cardiogenic (MI)
Fever + warm skin	Septic
Hives + wheezing	Anaphylactic
Bradycardia + trauma	Neurogenic
Dyspnea + hypoxia	Obstructive (PE/PTX)

Include lung sounds
Here’s an expanded Shock Reference Table including lung sounds for each type, helping you differentiate shock types in the field:

Shock Types, Lung Sounds & Key Features
Type of Shock	Cause	Lung Sounds	Other Key Signs	Emergency Treatment
Hypovolemic	Blood/fluid loss	Normal (unless pulmonary edema late)	Tachycardia, cool/clammy skin, weak pulses, flat neck veins	Fluids (NS/LR), blood, stop bleeding
Cardiogenic	Heart failure (e.g., MI)	Crackles/Rales (pulmonary edema)	JVD, S3 gallop, cyanosis, hypotension	Oxygen, nitroglycerin (if BP >90), diuretics (if CHF), inotropes
Septic	Infection → vasodilation	Normal or crackles (late ARDS)	Fever/chills, warm/flushed skin, hypotension	Antibiotics, fluids, norepinephrine
Anaphylactic	Severe allergy	Wheezing/Stridor (bronchospasm)	Hives, angioedema, hypotension, hoarseness	Epinephrine IM, albuterol, diphenhydramine, steroids
Neurogenic	Spinal cord injury (T6+)	Normal	Bradycardia + hypotension, warm/dry skin below injury	Fluids (cautious), vasopressors, atropine if bradycardic
Obstructive (PE)	Pulmonary embolism	Normal (or pleural rub if infarct)	Sudden dyspnea, hypoxia, tachycardia, calf swelling	Oxygen, heparin, thrombolytics (massive PE)
Obstructive (Tamponade)	Fluid around heart	Muffled/distant (effusion)	Beck’s triad (JVD, hypotension, muffled heart sounds)	Pericardiocentesis
Obstructive (Tension PTX)	Lung collapse	Absent unilateral (affected side)	Tracheal deviation, hypotension, subcutaneous emphysema	Needle decompression (2nd ICS)
Key Points on Lung Sounds in Shock
Crackles/Rales → Cardiogenic (fluid overload).

Wheezing/Stridor → Anaphylactic (airway obstruction).

Absent Sounds (unilateral) → Tension Pneumothorax.

Muffled Sounds → Cardiac Tamponade.

Normal Sounds → Early septic, neurogenic, or hypovolemic shock.

Shock Triads (For Rapid Diagnosis)
Shock Type	Triad
Beck’s (Tamponade)	Hypotension + JVD + muffled heart sounds
Tension PTX	Hypotension + absent breath sounds + tracheal deviation
Anaphylaxis	Hypotension + wheezing + hives
Field Tips
Listen to lung bases FIRST (crackles = cardiogenic).

Wheezing + rash? Think anaphylaxis → EPI NOW.

Clear lungs + hypotension? Consider septic or hypovolemic.

Bradycardia + trauma? Neurogenic shock (unlike other shocks, which cause tachycardia).
