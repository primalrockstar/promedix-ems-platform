# CHAPTER 21: ALLERGY AND ANAPHYLAXIS

## Core Definitions
- **Allergic Reaction**: Exaggerated immune response by body's immune system
- **Anaphylaxis**: Extreme, life-threatening allergic reaction involving multiple organ systems
- **Histamines/Leukotrienes**: Key chemicals released causing symptoms

## Recognition & Assessment

### Mild Allergic Reactions
- Itching, redness, tenderness
- Local and contained

### Severe Reactions (Anaphylaxis)
- **Skin**: Urticaria (hives), angioedema
- **Respiratory**: Wheezing, **STRIDOR** (most reliable upper airway indicator), bronchospasm
- **Cardiovascular**: Hypotension, increased capillary permeability
- **GI**: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps

## Five Categories of Common Allergens

| Category | Examples | Characteristics |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **1. Foods** (Most Common) | Shellfish, peanuts | Symptoms 30+ min; severe without skin signs |
| **2. Medications** (2nd Most) | Penicillin, NSAIDs | Injected = immediate; Oral = 30+ min |
| **3. Plants** | Ragweed, oak, maple | Rapid/severe possible |
| **4. Chemicals** | Makeup, latex | Use nitrile gloves, not latex |
| **5. Insects** | Bees, wasps, hornets | 2M allergic; 62 deaths/year; honey bee stinger embeds 20 min |

## Patient Assessment Protocol

### Scene Size-Up → Primary → Transport Decision
- **ABCs repeatedly assessed**
- Position: High Fowler's (comfort) or supine (shock)
- **Immediate transport** if anaphylaxis suspected
- "Err on the side of emergency transport"

### Stinger Removal
- **DO**: Scrape with stiff object (credit card)
- **DON'T**: Use tweezers/forceps
- Wash, remove jewelry, position below heart, ice max 10 minutes

## Epinephrine (EpiPen) - CRITICAL

### Mechanism
- Sympathomimetic hormone
- Constricts blood vessels (reverses hypotension)
- Increases cardiac contractility
- Relieves bronchospasms

### Dosages & Administration
- **Adult**: 0.3 mg
- **Child/Infant**: 0.15 mg
- **Hold**: At least 10 seconds
- **Onset**: Within 1 minute

### **DECISION RULE**
- **GIVE EPI IF**: Respiratory compromise OR hypotension present
- **DON'T GIVE IF**: No respiratory compromise AND no hypotension
- **ALWAYS TRANSPORT**: Even if patient feels better (effects wear off)

# CHAPTER 22: TOXICOLOGY

## Four Routes of Exposure

| Route | % | Priority Actions |
|-------|---|-----------------|
| **Ingestion** | 80% | Activated charcoal consideration, protect airway |
| **Inhalation** | - | Fresh air, oxygen, Hazmat if toxic gas |
| **Absorption** | - | Decontamination, brush dry powder first, flush |
| **Injection** | - | Cannot remove/dilute, supportive care, prompt transport |

## Activated Charcoal

### Key Facts
- **Dose**: 1 gram per kilogram body weight
- **Conversion**: Pounds ÷ 2.2 = kilograms
- **Standard bottle**: 50 grams
- **Example**: 55-pound child = 25 kg = 25 grams needed

### Indications/Contraindications
- **Give**: Conscious patient who can protect airway, certain toxins
- **Don't Give**: Decreased LOC, alkali poisons, cyanide, ethanol, iron, lithium, methanol, acids, solvents
- **Requires**: Medical control pre-approval

## Specific Substances

### Alcohol (CNS Depressant)
- **Effects**: Dulls senses, aggressive behavior
- **Complications**: Hypoglycemia (check blood sugar)
- **Withdrawal**: DTs - agitation, fever, sweating, tremors, seizures

### Opiates/Opioids
- **Signs**: Severe respiratory depression, pinpoint pupils, unconsciousness
- **Treatment**: **Naloxone (Narcan)** IV/IM/Intranasal

### Sympathomimetics (Stimulants)
- **Examples**: Amphetamines, cocaine, MDMA
- **Signs**: Hypertension, tachycardia, dilated pupils, paranoia
- **Risks**: Seizures, cardiac dysrhythmias, stroke

### Anticholinergics vs Cholinergics

| Type | Memory Aid | Examples | Key Features |
|------|------------|----------|--------------|
| **Anticholinergic** | "Hot as hare, blind as bat, dry as bone, red as beet, mad as hatter" | Atropine, Benadryl, tricyclics | Death within 30 minutes possible |
| **Cholinergic** | **DUMBELS** or **SLUDGE M** | Nerve gas, organophosphates | Antidote: DuoDote (atropine + pralidoxime) |

**DUMBELS**: Diarrhea, Urination, Miosis, Bradycardia, Emesis, Lacrimation, Seizures
**SLUDGE M**: Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Defecation, Gastric upsets, Emesis, Muscle twitching

### Food Poisoning
- **Salmonella**: Severe GI, 72 hours
- **Staphylococcus**: Sudden onset 2-12 hours, unrefrigerated food
- **Botulism**: Most severe, neurologic (blurred vision, weakness), 24 hours to 4 days

# CHAPTER 23: BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EMERGENCIES

## Key Concepts
- **Behavioral Crisis**: Inappropriate behavior becoming unacceptable/dangerous
- **Most people with mental health disorders are NOT dangerous**
- EMTs see more violent patients because they respond to crises

## Underlying Causes

### Organic (Physical)
- Hypoglycemia, hypoxia, TBI, seizures, drug/alcohol, infections
- **Remember**: Medical causes first

### Functional (Psychological)
- Schizophrenia, anxiety, depression when body structurally normal

## Assessment & Management

### Scene Safety FIRST
- May need law enforcement backup immediately
- Stage until scene secured
- **De-escalation before restraint**

### Specific Conditions

#### Excited Delirium (Agitated Delirium)
- **Signs**: Hyperactive/irrational, hallucinations, hypertension, tachycardia, diaphoresis
- **Risk**: Sudden cardiac arrest, positional asphyxia
- **Never leave unattended**

#### Violence Risk Factors
- Previous violent behavior
- Tense posture, clenched fists
- Near lethal objects
- Loud, erratic speech
- Poor impulse control

#### Suicide Assessment
- **Depression**: Most significant factor
- **FALSE**: "Those who threaten won't do it"
- **Risk**: Specific plans, hopelessness, detachment
- **Remember**: Suicidal patients may also be homicidal

## Patient Restraints

### Restraint Protocol
- **Indications**: Protect self/others, prevent self-injury, allow treatment
- **Risks**: Positional asphyxia, aspiration, cardiac arrest
- **Procedure**: 5 people ideal, four-point restraints preferred
- **NEVER leave restrained patient unattended**
- **Reassess**: Every 5 minutes for circulation/respiration

## PTSD in Combat Veterans
- **Statistics**: 7-8% general population, higher in military
- **Management**: Eliminate excess noise, don't touch without explanation, calm tone, respect space
- **Remember**: Trained with weapons, resourceful with improvised weapons

# CHAPTER 24: GYNECOLOGIC EMERGENCIES

## Female Reproductive Anatomy

| Structure | Location/Function |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Ovaries** | Each side lower abdomen; produce eggs |
| **Fallopian Tubes** | Connect ovaries to uterus; fertilization site |
| **Uterus** | Muscular organ; fetus grows here |
| **Cervix** | Narrowest part of uterus; opens to vagina |
| **Vagina** | Outermost cavity of reproductive system |

### Key Terms
- **Menarche**: Onset menstruation (ages 11-16)
- **Menopause**: End menstrual activity (~50 years)
- **Ovulation**: Release of ovum monthly
- **Menstruation**: Occurs if no fertilization within 14 days

## Common Gynecologic Emergencies

### Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)
- **Pathophysiology**: Infection of upper reproductive organs
- **Symptoms**: Generalized lower abdominal pain, abnormal/foul discharge, increased pain with intercourse, fever, malaise
- **Risk Factors**: Multiple partners, untreated STDs, sexually active under 26, douching, IUD use
- **Assessment**: Pain starts during/after menstruation, worse with walking (shuffling gait)
- **Treatment**: Limited prehospital, usually non-emergency transport

### Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)
- **Chlamydia**: Most common STD in US, usually mild/absent symptoms
- **Bacterial Vaginosis**: Most common infection ages 15-44, can cause premature birth
- **Gonorrhea**: Severe infections with cramping, bleeding between periods

### Vaginal Bleeding
- **Causes**: Abnormal menstruation, trauma, ectopic pregnancy, abortion, polyps, cancer
- **Assessment**: Note quality and quantity of bleeding

## Patient Assessment Protocol

### Scene Safety & Primary Assessment
1. Scene safety first
2. Standard precautions (large amounts of blood/fluids possible)
3. Document accurately (especially if crime scene)
4. Police involvement if assault suspected
5. Female EMT preferred for sexual assault cases

### History Taking
- Be sensitive (personal questions)
- Protect privacy and dignity
- For abdominal pain: OPQRST
- For vaginal bleeding: OPQRST + SAMPLE
- Ask about birth control, medical conditions, last menstrual period

### Secondary Assessment
- Focus on chief complaint area
- Check vital signs
- Assess abdomen for distension/tenderness
- Note visible bleeding and mental status
- **Physical exams limited and professional**
- **Only examine genitalia if necessary for treatment**

## Emergency Care Principles

| Principle | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Maintain Privacy** | Get patient to private location if possible |
| **Female EMT** | Have female EMT participate if possible |
| **Vaginal Bleeding** | Use sanitary pads externally, document saturated pads |
| **Never** | Pack or place dressings in vagina |
| **External Injuries** | Treat with sterile compresses |

## Sexual Assault Considerations
- **Medical, psychological, and legal issues**
- **Professionalism, tact, kindness, sensitivity**
- Be aware of incapacitating drugs
- Focus on medical treatment, psychological care, evidence preservation
- **Persuade patient not to clean themselves**
- Offer Rape Crisis Center contact
- **Limit physical exam** to brief survey for life-threatening injuries
