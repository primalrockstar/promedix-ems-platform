# EMS Respiratory Emergencies by Scope of Practice

## Overview
Respiratory emergencies are among the most common EMS calls and require rapid assessment and intervention. Early recognition of respiratory distress versus respiratory failure is critical, as progression can be rapid and life-threatening.

## Classification of Respiratory Emergencies

### Respiratory Distress vs. Respiratory Failure
**Respiratory Distress**: Patient is working harder to breathe but maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation
**Respiratory Failure**: Patient cannot maintain adequate oxygenation and/or ventilation despite increased work of breathing
