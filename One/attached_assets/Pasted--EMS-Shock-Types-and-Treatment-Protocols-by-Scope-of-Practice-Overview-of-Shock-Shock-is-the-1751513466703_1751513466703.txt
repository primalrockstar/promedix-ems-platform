# EMS Shock Types and Treatment Protocols by Scope of Practice

## Overview of Shock
Shock is the widespread failure of the circulatory system to supply adequate oxygen and nourishment to the tissues and organs. Early recognition and treatment are critical to prevent progression to irreversible shock and death.

## Classification of Shock Types

There are mainly four broad categories of shock: distributive, hypovolemic, cardiogenic, and obstructive.

## 1. HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK

### Definition
Hypovolemic shock is a life-threatening condition caused by a significant reduction in blood volume, which prevents the heart from pumping enough blood to meet the body's needs.

### Causes
- **Hemorrhagic**: Trauma, GI bleeding, surgical complications, ruptured aneurysm
- **Non-hemorrhagic**: Severe dehydration, burns, excessive vomiting/diarrhea

### Signs and Symptoms
**Early (Compensated)**
- Tachycardia
- Normal to slightly decreased blood pressure
- Pale, cool, clammy skin
- Anxiety, restlessness
- Thirst
- Decreased urination

**Late (Decompensated)**
- Severe hypotension
- Weak, thready pulse
- Altered mental status
- Mottled skin
- Delayed capillary refill (>2 seconds)

### Treatment by Scope

#### EMT Scope
- High-flow oxygen
- Position patient supine with legs elevated (if no trauma)
- Control external bleeding with direct pressure, pressure points, tourniquets
- Keep patient warm
- Rapid transport
- Monitor vital signs

#### AEMT Scope
- All EMT interventions plus:
- IV access with large-bore catheters (14-16 gauge)
- Normal saline or Lactated Ringer's fluid bolus
- Advanced airway management if needed

#### Paramedic Scope
- All AEMT interventions plus:
- Multiple large-bore IV access
- Aggressive fluid resuscitation (20ml/kg boluses, reassess)

## 2. CARDIOGENIC SHOCK

**CRITICAL NOTE**: patients in cardiogenic shock should never be given IV fluids

## 3. DISTRIBUTIVE SHOCK

- Weak pulse
- Decreased urination

### Treatment by Scope

#### EMT Scope

#### Paramedic Scope
- All AEMT interventions plus:
- Aggressive fluid resuscitation (30ml/kg initial bolus)
- Vasopressor support if hypotensive despite fluids
- Consider antibiotic coordination with hospital
- Advanced monitoring

## 3B. ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK

### Definition
Severe, life-threatening allergic reaction causing widespread vasodilation and increased vascular permeability.

### Causes
- Food allergens (nuts, shellfish, etc.)
- Medications (antibiotics, NSAIDs)
- Insect stings
- Environmental allergens

### Signs and Symptoms
- Rapid onset (minutes to hours)
- Urticaria (hives), angioedema
- Respiratory distress, wheezing, stridor
- Hypotension, tachycardia
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
- Sense of impending doom

## GENERAL SHOCK MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES

### Universal EMS Interventions (All Levels)
1. **Airway Management**: Ensure patent airway
2. **Breathing Support**: High-flow oxygen, assist ventilations if needed
3. **Circulation**: Control bleeding, establish IV access per scope
4. **Disability**: Assess neurological status
5. **Exposure**: Prevent heat loss, examine for injuries

### Fluid Resuscitation Guidelines
- The majority of patients in shock require IV fluids to slow or prevent them from progressing to decompensated or irreversible shock. Septic shock and hypovolemic shock always require IV fluids. Neurogenic and anaphylactic shock sometimes require them
- **Hypovolemic/Septic**: Aggressive fluid resuscitation
- **Cardiogenic**: Avoid fluids (contraindicated)
- **Anaphylactic/Neurogenic**: Cautious fluid administration
- **Obstructive**: Variable depending on cause

### Transport Considerations
- Load and go vs. stay and play depends on:
  - Type of shock
  - Response to initial treatment
  - Transport time to appropriate facility
  - Available interventions
- Consider helicopter transport for:
  - Remote locations
  - Trauma centers >30 minutes away
  - Need for specialized care (cardiac catheterization, trauma surgery)

### Documentation Requirements
- Time of onset
- Initial vital signs and mental status
- Interventions performed and patient response
- Ongoing assessment findings
- Reason for transport destination choice
