EMT Patient Assessment Study Guide: Medical & Trauma
1. Scene Size-Up
BSI (Body Substance Isolation): Ensure gloves, mask, eye protection, gown as needed.

Scene Safety: Look for hazards (traffic, fire, violence, chemicals, etc.).

Mechanism of Injury (MOI) / Nature of Illness (NOI):

Trauma: Consider forces involved (e.g., car crash, fall, gunshot).

Medical: Identify possible causes (e.g., chest pain, difficulty breathing, altered mental status).

Number of Patients: Determine if additional resources are needed (more ambulances, fire department, police).

Request Additional Help if Needed: ALS, fire, hazmat, etc.

2. Primary Survey (ABCDE Approach)
A â€“ Airway
Assess: Is the airway open? Listen for sounds (snoring, gurgling, stridor).

Interventions:

Medical: Head-tilt chin-lift (if no trauma), suction if needed.

Trauma: Jaw-thrust if spinal injury suspected.

Consider adjuncts (OPA/NPA) if patient is unresponsive.

B â€“ Breathing
Assess: Rate, depth, effort (labored? retractions? accessory muscle use?).

Listen: Breath sounds (equal bilaterally? wheezing, crackles, absent sounds?).

Interventions:

Assist ventilations with BVM if inadequate breathing.

Administer oxygen if hypoxic (SpOâ‚‚ < 94%).

Seal open chest wounds (trauma).

C â€“ Circulation
Assess:

Pulse (rate, rhythm, strength).

Skin (color, temperature, moisture â€“ pale, cool, clammy?).

Major bleeding (control with direct pressure, tourniquet if severe).

Interventions:

Control hemorrhage.

Treat for shock (keep warm, elevate legs if no trauma, IV fluids per protocol).

D â€“ Disability (Neurological Status)
Assess: AVPU or Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS).

Alert

Verbal response

Painful response

Unresponsive

Pupils: PEARRL (Pupils Equal And Round, Reactive to Light).

Interventions: Consider glucose check, spinal immobilization if trauma.

E â€“ Exposure / Environment
Assess: Remove clothing as needed to check for injuries (trauma) or medical signs (rash, swelling).

Interventions: Prevent hypothermia (cover patient after exam).

3. History Taking (SAMPLE & OPQRST)
SAMPLE History (Medical & Trauma)
Symptoms

Allergies

Medications

Past medical history

Last oral intake

Events leading to incident

OPQRST (Pain Assessment)
Onset

Provocation/Palliation

Quality

Radiation

Severity (1-10 scale)

Time

4. Secondary Assessment
Medical Patients (Focused Exam)
Vitals: BP, HR, RR, SpOâ‚‚, blood glucose if indicated.

Head-to-Toe: Based on chief complaint (e.g., lung sounds for respiratory distress, abdominal tenderness for pain).

Special Considerations: Stroke (FAST), cardiac (chest pain), diabetic emergencies, seizures.

Trauma Patients (Full Body Exam)
DCAP-BTLS:

Deformities

Contusions

Abrasions

Punctures/Penetrations

Burns

Tenderness

Lacerations

Swelling

Check:

Head: Scalp wounds, Battleâ€™s sign, raccoon eyes.

Neck: JVD, tracheal deviation, crepitus.

Chest: Paradoxical movement, flail segment.

Abdomen: Distension, rigidity, guarding.

Pelvis: Stability (do not compress if fracture suspected).

Extremities: PMS (Pulse, Motor, Sensory).

Back: Log roll if spinal injury suspected.

5. Reassessment
Repeat Primary Survey if condition changes.

Monitor Vitals every 5 min (unstable) or 15 min (stable).

Check Interventions: Oxygen, bleeding control, splints.

Document Findings: Changes in condition, treatments given.

Key Differences: Medical vs. Trauma Assessment
Factor	Medical	Trauma
Focus	History & symptoms	Mechanism of Injury (MOI)
Airway	Head-tilt chin-lift (if no trauma)	Jaw-thrust (if spinal concern)
Priority	Underlying condition	Life-threatening bleeding/injuries
Exam	Focused (based on complaint)	Full-body (DCAP-BTLS)
Common Pitfalls to Avoid
Missing hidden bleeding (check under clothes, back).

Not reassessing after interventions (e.g., after giving albuterol, check breathing again).

Overlooking spinal precautions in trauma patients.

Failing to consider environmental factors (hypothermia, heat stroke).

Final Tip:
"Treat the patient, not the monitor." Vitals help, but patient presentation is key!

Good luck with your studies! ðŸš‘ðŸ’¨
