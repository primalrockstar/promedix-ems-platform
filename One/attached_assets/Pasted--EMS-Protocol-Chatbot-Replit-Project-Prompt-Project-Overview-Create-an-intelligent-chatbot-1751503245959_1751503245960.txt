# EMS Protocol Chatbot - Replit Project Prompt

## Project Overview
Create an intelligent chatbot for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel that provides instant access to medical protocols, drug information, and interactive learning tools. This bot will serve as a digital assistant for paramedics, EMTs, and EMS students.

## Core Functionality Requirements

### 1. Protocol Assistant
- **Drug Information Queries**: Instant dosing, contraindications, and administration routes
- **Medical Protocol Navigation**: Step-by-step guidance through emergency protocols
- **Assessment Tool Support**: Interactive checklists for FAST, GCS, APGAR, etc.
- **Equipment Guidance**: Instructions for medical device usage and troubleshooting

### 2. Interactive Learning System
- **Scenario-Based Training**: Generate emergency scenarios for practice
- **Quiz Generation**: Adaptive quizzes on EMS topics with immediate feedback
- **Concept Explanations**: Break down complex medical concepts into understandable language
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor learning achievements and identify knowledge gaps

### 3. Real-Time Emergency Support
- **Quick Reference Lookups**: Instant access to critical information during calls
- **Decision Trees**: Guide users through complex medical decision-making
- **Timer Integration**: Built-in timers for time-sensitive procedures
- **Voice Input Support**: Hands-free operation for field use

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
```javascript
// Core structure needed:
- Express.js server for API endpoints
- WebSocket connections for real-time chat
- Database integration (PostgreSQL/SQLite) for protocols
- Pattern matching engine for keyword recognition
- LOCAL KNOWLEDGE BASE ONLY - no external API calls
- Content validation system to ensure responses come from app data
```

### Frontend (React/HTML)
```javascript
// UI Components required:
- Chat interface with message history
- Quick action buttons for common queries
- Search functionality for protocol database
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet use
- Dark mode for low-light environments
```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Essential tables for LOCAL KNOWLEDGE BASE:
protocols (id, name, category, steps, contraindications, keywords)
medications (id, name, adult_dose, pediatric_dose, contraindications, keywords)
assessments (id, name, steps, scoring, keywords)
procedures (id, name, equipment, steps, warnings, keywords)
user_interactions (id, query, response, timestamp, source_table)
learning_progress (user_id, topic, score, date)
content_index (id, content_type, content_id, searchable_text)

-- CRITICAL: All responses must reference existing app content
-- No external data sources or AI-generated content allowed
```

## Critical Content Restriction Requirements

### ‚ö†Ô∏è LOCAL KNOWLEDGE BASE ONLY
**The chatbot must NEVER access external information sources. All responses must come exclusively from content stored within the app's database.**

### Content Source Validation
```javascript
// Every chatbot response must include source validation:
const validateResponse = (response, query) => {
  // Ensure response content exists in local database
  const sourceFound = checkLocalDatabase(response.content);
  if (!sourceFound) {
    return "I can only provide information from the protocols and resources loaded in this app. Please check the main sections for that information.";
  }
  return response;
};
```

### Restricted Information Handling
- **Unknown Topics**: "I don't have information about that in my current database. Please check the main protocol sections."
- **External References**: "I can only reference information that's been loaded into this app."
- **Medical Updates**: "This app contains specific protocol versions. Check with your medical director for the most current guidelines."

### Content Boundaries
```javascript
// Approved content sources within app:
- Loaded EMS protocols and procedures
- Pre-populated medication database
- Assessment tools and scoring systems
- Equipment operation guides
- Training scenarios created within the app

// FORBIDDEN content sources:
- External websites or APIs
- Real-time medical updates
- AI-generated medical advice
- User-contributed content without validation
- Any information not explicitly loaded into the app database
```

## Sample Chatbot Interactions (LOCAL CONTENT ONLY)

### Drug Information (From App Database)
```
User: "What's the dose of epi for anaphylaxis?"
Bot: "From our medication database:
     Epinephrine for anaphylaxis:
     ‚Ä¢ Adult: 0.3-0.5mg IM (1:1000) lateral thigh
     ‚Ä¢ Pediatric: 0.01mg/kg IM (max 0.3mg)
     ‚Ä¢ Repeat every 5-15 minutes if needed
     ‚ö†Ô∏è Source: App Protocol Database - Anaphylaxis Section"

User: "What about Drug X?"
Bot: "I don't have information about Drug X in my current database. Please check the main medication reference section or consult your protocol manual."
```

### Protocol Guidance (From Local Protocols)
```
User: "Chest pain protocol"
Bot: "From our chest pain protocol (loaded version 2.1):
     1. ‚úÖ Obtain vital signs
     2. ‚è±Ô∏è 12-lead ECG
     3. ü©∫ OPQRST pain assessment
     4. üíä Consider aspirin if no contraindications
     
     This guidance comes from the protocols loaded in this app. What's your next step?"

User: "What about the new 2024 guidelines?"
Bot: "I can only reference the protocol versions loaded in this app. For the most current guidelines, please check with your medical director or update the app protocols."
```

### Learning Mode (From App Content)
```
User: "Quiz me on cardiac rhythms"
Bot: "Cardiac Rhythm Quiz from our training database:
     Question 1/10 - Based on rhythms in our learning section
     üìä [Shows ECG from app database]
     What rhythm is this?
     A) Normal sinus rhythm
     B) Atrial fibrillation  
     C) Ventricular tachycardia
     D) Atrial flutter
     
     Source: App Training Module - Cardiac Rhythms"
```

### Content Boundary Examples
```
User: "What's the latest research on cardiac arrest?"
Bot: "I can only provide information from the protocols and resources loaded in this app. For the latest research, please consult current medical literature or check with your medical director."

User: "Can you look up information online?"
Bot: "I don't have access to external information. I can only help with the protocols, medications, and procedures stored in this app's database."
```
