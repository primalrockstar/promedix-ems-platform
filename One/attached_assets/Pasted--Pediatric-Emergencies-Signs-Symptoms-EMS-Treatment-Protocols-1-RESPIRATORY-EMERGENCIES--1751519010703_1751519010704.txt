## GENERAL PEDIATRIC CONSIDERATIONS

### Vital Sign Ranges by Age:
- **Newborn (0-3 months):** HR 100-160, RR 30-50, SBP 60-90
- **Infant (3-12 months):** HR 100-150, RR 25-40, SBP 70-100
- **Toddler (1-3 years):** HR 90-140, RR 20-30, SBP 80-110

- **School age (6-12 years):** HR 70-110, RR 15-20, SBP 90-120

### Medication Dosing Considerations:
- Weight-based dosing is critical
- Broselow tape for rapid weight estimation
- Double-check all calculations
- Consider age-appropriate routes (rectal, intranasal)

### Special Considerations:
- Family-centered care when possible
- Consider non-accidental trauma
- Hypothermia prevention
- Appropriate restraint and immobilization
- Communication appropriate for developmental level
