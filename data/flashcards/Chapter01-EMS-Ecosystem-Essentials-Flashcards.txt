# Chapter 1: EMS Ecosystem Essentials - Flashcards

## Card 1
**Q:** What are the four key components of the EMS system?
**A:** First Responders (police, fire), EMTs (basic life support), Paramedics (advanced life support), and Emergency Departments (hospital-based care).

## Card 2
**Q:** What does the acronym AVPU stand for in patient assessment?
**A:** Alert (awake and aware), Verbal (responds to verbal stimuli), Pain (responds only to painful stimuli), Unresponsive (no response to any stimuli).

## Card 3
**Q:** What is the normal respiratory rate range for adults?
**A:** 12-20 breaths per minute.

## Card 4
**Q:** What is the normal pulse rate range for adults?
**A:** 60-100 beats per minute.

## Card 5
**Q:** What is the normal systolic blood pressure range for adults?
**A:** 90-140 mmHg.

## Card 6
**Q:** What is considered normal body temperature?
**A:** 98.6°F (37°C).

## Card 7
**Q:** List three components of EMT-B scope of practice.
**A:** Patient assessment using AVPU scale, basic airway management, oxygen administration, CPR and AED operation, basic trauma care, and limited medication assistance.

## Card 8
**Q:** What is the primary principle of EMS system operation?
**A:** Rapid assessment, stabilization, and transport to appropriate medical facilities.

## Card 9
**Q:** What type of care do EMTs provide?
**A:** Basic life support (BLS).

## Card 10
**Q:** What type of care do Paramedics provide?
**A:** Advanced life support (ALS).

## Card 11
**Q:** In the AVPU scale, what does "Verbal" mean?
**A:** The patient responds to verbal stimuli but is not fully alert.

## Card 12
**Q:** What is the normal diastolic blood pressure range?
**A:** 60-90 mmHg (though the chapter focuses on systolic 90-140 mmHg as the key range).

## Card 13
**Q:** What are the main areas of EMT-B medication assistance?
**A:** Limited scope medication assistance within approved protocols (specific medications covered in later chapters).

## Card 14
**Q:** What does "basic airway management" include for EMT-B?
**A:** Airway opening maneuvers, oxygen administration, and basic airway adjuncts.

## Card 15
**Q:** What is the key difference between First Responders and EMTs?
**A:** First Responders (police, fire) provide initial response, while EMTs provide basic life support and patient transport.
