# Chapter 32: Orthopedic Injuries Essentials - Flashcards

## Card 1
**Q:** What are the four fracture classifications?
**A:** Closed fractures, open fractures, displaced fractures, comminuted fractures.

## Card 2
**Q:** What is a closed fracture?
**A:** Skin integrity maintained, no external bleeding.

## Card 3
**Q:** What is an open fracture?
**A:** Bone protrudes or skin broken over fracture site.

## Card 4
**Q:** What are the four splinting principles?
**A:** Immobilize joint above and below, assess neurovascular status, pad pressure points, secure firmly.

## Card 5
**Q:** What three things must be checked in neurovascular assessment?
**A:** Pulse, motor function, sensation distal to injury.

## Card 6
**Q:** When should neurovascular assessment be performed?
**A:** Before and after splinting.

## Card 7
**Q:** What pulse points are checked for upper extremity injuries?
**A:** Radial and ulnar pulses.

## Card 8
**Q:** What pulse points are checked for lower extremity injuries?
**A:** Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.

## Card 9
**Q:** What is normal capillary refill time?
**A:** <2 seconds normal, >2 seconds abnormal.

## Card 10
**Q:** What special consideration applies to femur fractures?
**A:** Potential for significant blood loss and shock risk.

## Card 11
**Q:** How should pelvic fractures be managed?
**A:** Assess for internal bleeding, stabilize with sheet.

## Card 12
**Q:** What should you do with joint dislocations?
**A:** Immobilize in position found, do not reduce.

## Card 13
**Q:** What are the types of splinting materials?
**A:** Rigid splints, soft splints, traction splints, improvised splints.

## Card 14
**Q:** When are traction splints used?
**A:** Specific for femur fractures with protocols.

## Card 15
**Q:** What is the key principle of orthopedic injury management?
**A:** Neurovascular preservation, proper immobilization, pain control, and prevention of further injury through appropriate splinting techniques and patient handling.
